	description: James was a graduate student with Tom Alber at UC Berkeley, where he studied protein structure and dynamics. There, he developed biophysical methods to characterize protein side chain flexibility and applied these techniques to study connections between conformational dynamics and enzymatic catalysis. In January 2011, James started his independent career as a QB3 at UCSF Fellow. In January 2013, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences.
