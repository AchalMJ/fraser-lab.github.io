	description: "James was a graduate student with Tom Alber at UC Berkeley, where he studied protein structure and dynamics. There, he developed biophysical methods to characterize protein side chain flexibility and applied these techniques to study connections between conformational dynamics and enzymatic catalysis. In January 2011, James started his independent career as a QB3 at UCSF Fellow. In January 2013, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences."

  description: "Daniel was a graduate student at Duke University with Jane and David Richardson, where he studied protein flexibility in structure validation, prediction, and design. In the Fraser lab, he will develop techniques to build multi-conformer structural models, extract functional cooperative conformational changes, and engineer allosteric/drug-sensitive proteins."

  description: "David graduated from Reed College in Biochemistry after working with Dr. Jay Mellies on E. coli virulence factors. He then worked with Dr. Alan Frankel at UCSF before joining iPQB in biophysics. Currently he is investigating the conformational dynamics of protein-protein interactions. When not in lab, David enjoys making music, swing dancing and playing with his 70 lbs beast, Lucy."

- name: Andrew VanBenschoten

  description: "Andrew completed his undergraduate studies in biology at MIT. While there, he worked with Cathy Drennan on determining the structure of metalloenzymes via X-ray crystallography. Andrew started at UCSF in the fall of 2011 and is investigating the features of diffuse X-ray scatter in several model protein systems and molecular machines."

- name: Rahel Woldeyes

  twitter: @rahelwoldeyes
  description: "Rahel graduated from University of Minnesota â€“ Twin cities with B.S in Biochemistry and Chemistry. As an undergraduate student, she worked in several labs on projects ranging from cell to structural biology. In the Fraser lab, Rahel will be studying the structure-dynamics-function relationships of proteins and protein-ligand complexes using a combination of room temperature X-ray Crystallography and NMR approaches. Furthermore, she will be developing and implementing methods to dissect allostery in drug targets."
